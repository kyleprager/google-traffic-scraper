google-traffic-scraper

Scrapes Google's directions results for routes and driving times with and without traffic.

This was meant to be run as a cron job and have that append to a file in CSV format or the like.  Then one can look at the data on a graph and decide which route is best to take and when.

To run the app:

1.  npm install
2.  node server.js
